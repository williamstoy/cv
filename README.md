Developed a novel microfluidic flow cytometry system for directed evolution of voltage sensitive membrane proteins. System is capable of measuring 10,000 novel protein constructs per second and enables differential measurements of rapid (1-100 μs) changes in protein structure. System design included optical, pneumatic, and instrumentation design, including high speed ADC and FPGA implementation. Additional design of novel microfluidic flow focusing device is currently under disclosure for patent application. Led a team of 4 individuals (masters and PhD students) in the design of the software and hardware for the project in a cross institutional collaboration.

In vivo whole cell patch-clamp recording is one of the most important and versatile techniques in neuroscience. Whole cell recordings have enabled stable investigation of subthreshold activity to identify cell types and circuits in the intact brain. However, the success rate is incredibly low when this procedure is performed manually ( 10% in the cortex and ¡1% success rate in deeper tissue e.g. the thalamus). Two factors contribute to the low success rate of in vivo recordings: 1) Pipettes clogged by blood vessels during insertion through overlying tissue and 2) Physiological motion from the animals heartbeat and breathing causes cells move with respect to the pipette tip gigaseal formation. I developed an algorithm to detect and move around blood vessels during pipette insertion, and detected the heartbeat and breathing of the animal to perform real-time synchronization of the pipette position to the cell surface with nanometer precision. A 25x improvement in whole-cell yield over manual methods using the combination of these two techniques was demonstrated and applied the system with optogenetic and sensory stimulation in transgenic mice. Together, these tools represent a fully automated platform for acquisition of sensitive electrical recordings in previously inaccessible tissue that will enable neuroscientists to unravel neural codes in early sensory processing brain regions.
